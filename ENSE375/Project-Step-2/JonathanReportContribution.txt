2.1 DeepSource Code Review Plugin
	A developer team is fallible when it comes to writing code. 
To catch errors before deployment, a team may choose to hold 
numerous code reviews. To help with this, git extensions such as 
DeepSource continuously analyze the source files.

DeepSource is a Code review plugin that will continuously analyze 
code in a repository. This service can detect and flag 
anti-patterns, bug risks, and any code that may reduce performance. 
It does this by connecting to a repository and run scripts 
at a file level. DeepSource currently supports the 
following languages:  Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. In 
addition to detecting issues in code DeepSource can suggest fixes 
and create pull requests integrating the fixes.

Using a Code review plugin such as DeepSource can help automate
 code reviews as it helps find and fix errors with each commit. 
Like other automation tools, DeepSource saves a teamâ€™s time spent
 on debugging. Thus, allowing more time to be allocated other
 important development aspects such as testing.
